# Static Personal Website

  

This was my first delve into web design freshman year. I learned about some tools such as making an Express.js server, jQuery, and Google reCAPTCHA.

  

## *Getting Started*

* In the root directory, run command `npm install`
* After install is complete, run `npm start`
* The website will be live at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)!
